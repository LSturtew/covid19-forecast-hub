     We use our own epidemic model called SI-kJalpha which allows for heterogeneous infection rate and can account for human mobility. A preliminary version of this model was successfully used during DARPA Grand Challenge 2014 for CHIKV forecasting. By linearizing the model and using weighted least squares, our model is able to quickly adapt to changing trends and provide extremely accurate predictions of confirmed cases and deaths at the level of countries and states of the United States. The variations in parameters during different times/policies allow us to forecast different scenarios such as what would happen if we were to disregard social distancing suggestions. The evaluation of our model against other forecasting models can be found on the "leaderboard" at https://scc-usc.github.io/ReCOVER-COVID-19.
