    Forecasts of incidence are generated through the following procedure:
    1) Calculate first differences of incidence; 2) Collect all first
    differences and their negatives; 3) Sample first differences in incidence
    and add to the most recent observed incidence; 4) Enforce that the mean of
    the predictive distribution for incidence is equal to the most recent
    observed incidence; 5) truncate the predictive distribution for incidence at
    0.  Forecasts of cumulative quantities are obtained by adding forecasts of
    incidence to the last observed cumulative value.
